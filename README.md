👋 Hi, I’m @cristim

🌱 I’m currently building apps in Go, and helping companies reduce their AWS costs.

So far I have the following apps, and bulding new ones all the time:
- [AutoSpotting](https://autospotting.io) - automation for optimizing AWS EC2 costs by up to 90%, by using Spot instances with maximum reliability and with least possible effort (mostly OSS, with a few commercial features)
- EBS Optimizer - catch-all automation for converting EBS volumes to GP3, typically with 20% cost savings (mostly OSS, with a few commercial features)
- a new GUI for both my cost optimization tools, using the [Fyne](https://fyne.io) GUI toolkit -  not OSS yet but planning to release it once ready
- a CLI tool for managing AWS Marketplace products - https://github.com/LeanerCloud/aws-marketplace-cli
- a Go library for exposing AWS instance type information - https://github.com/LeanerCloud/ec2-instances-info

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on business opportunities regarding AWS cost optimization
